# Hunting phishing pages for fun and ... fun ?


Cannot sleep like me ?


Time to hunt some phishing website and try to see how it works.

I often use [Urlscan.io](https://urlscan.io/)  for hunting phishing website. People can scan urls to check if it malicious or legitimate.


In the "Live" feed you can see a screenshot of websites being scanned.


It's always a bit weird because from time to time some NSFW content are posted - I warned you :)

You can easy see the url of the website, and screenshot + url can already help you to detect phishing website.

Let's take the example of this malicious phishing page (now removed) hxxp://www.paypallsupportcustomer.mixh.jp/pp/login.php


This website impersonate the paypal's login page. Let's take a look at url ... and take a step back.



Browsing to hxxp://www.paypallsupportcustomer.mixh[.]jp/ and Tada

We can see our pp/ folder where the login page is stored and a pp.zip


This archive contains a phishing kit with all the configuration and capabilities of the kits.

Let's analyze it quickly.

There is a config file in the inc folder with potentialy interesting information :

{% highlight shell %}
<?php $trackpass="www.jembotmawot.com"; ?>
{% endhighlight %}

*trackpass* is used in the panel folder and is used as a password.

I did not test if this password was the one used on this phishing campaign or if it has been modified.


But after i reported it to the paypal team the website was remove really quickly (around 10 minutes).

There is also a *logsz* folder containing txt file with info about the number of visitor, cc cards, ...)


171 visitors on the phishing page before the takedown.

I took a quick look at the url used in the password variables.


*Take care when browsing to this website as it might be monitored by malicious actors*

It's a website sharing phishing and scamming kits.


The one used in our analysis is :
